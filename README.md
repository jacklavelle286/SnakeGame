1. Run the game by executing the main.py file in the terminal with `python3 main.py`.
2. Use the arrow keys to move the snake: up, down, left, and right.
3. Eat the food that appears on the screen to increase your score.
4. Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body.
5. The game ends when the snake hits a wall or its own body.
